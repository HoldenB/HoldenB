## ü§ñ About

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer who previously worked on maritime autonomous systems and robotics, and now works on high-performance distributed healthcare eMHR systems.

My industry experience has landed me on a team that won the 2022 MedTech Breakthrough Award in healthcare technology for our Canopy platform (eMHR middleware).
I was previously part of a team that shipped globally-leading maritime autonomous systems that completed a successful 3000 nautical mile transit, while fully-unmanned.

I am currently in year one of my Master's in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Purdue University - West Lafayette. My focuses are in Computer Engineering and Automatic Control.
My research includes HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) and Multi-Agent Control in Noisy Environments.

Feel free to reach out to me via email [üìß](mailto:holden.bab@outlook.com) or social media.
